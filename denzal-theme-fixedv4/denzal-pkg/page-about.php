            <h1>Two NEPA Guys.<br>One <em>Simple Promise.</em></h1>
            <p>DenZal Construction was built on a handshake and a belief that people in Northeastern Pennsylvania deserve a builder they can actually trust — someone who shows up, keeps their word, and cares about the finished product as much as you do.</p>
            <p>That's not marketing copy. That's Chris and Ryan. It's how they've operated since day one, and it's why so many of their clients become repeat customers and lifelong friends.</p>

        <div class="ab-section-eyebrow">Our Story</div>
        <h2 class="ab-section-title">They Didn't Just Build Homes —<br>They <em>Built a Reputation.</em></h2>
        <p>Chris and Ryan grew up in Northeastern Pennsylvania. They learned the trades the old-fashioned way — by doing the work, side by side with experienced craftsmen who took pride in what they built. Over years in the field, they developed a deep respect for quality materials, honest pricing, and the kind of communication that keeps clients from losing sleep at night.</p>
        <blockquote class="ab-origin-pull">
            "We started this company because we saw too many people get burned by builders who overpromised and underdelivered. We knew we could do better — and we've spent every year since proving it."
        </blockquote>
        <p>When they founded DenZal Construction, they made a deliberate choice to stay small enough to be personally involved in every project. You won't get handed off to a project manager you've never met. When you call DenZal, Chris or Ryan picks up the phone.</p>
        <p>That approach — personal, accountable, rooted in the community — has built them a track record that speaks for itself: hundreds of homes across Lackawanna and Luzerne counties, and a client list full of people who'd refer them to their own family.</p>

                    <p>Chris has spent his entire career in the construction trades, starting out on job sites as a young man and working his way through every phase of the building process. That hands-on experience means he can spot a shortcut from a mile away — and won't tolerate one on his sites.</p>
                    <p>What sets Chris apart from most builders isn't just his technical knowledge — it's how he treats people. He communicates proactively, returns calls the same day, and has a genuine gift for making first-time homebuilders feel confident and informed every step of the way.</p>
                    <p>When Chris isn't overseeing a build, you'll find him right here in NEPA — rooted in the community he's spent his whole life in.</p>
                    <blockquote class="ab-bio-quote ab-bio-quote--blue">"I want every client to feel like they're our only client — because when it's your home, you deserve that kind of attention."</blockquote>

                    <p>Ryan brings a combination of field expertise and sharp organizational thinking that makes DenZal's builds run smoothly — on time and on budget, every time. He has a natural ability to keep complex projects coordinated across multiple trades without anything falling through the cracks.</p>
                    <p>Clients consistently describe Ryan as someone who goes above and beyond. He doesn't just manage a construction schedule — he anticipates problems before they become problems, and he keeps everyone on the same page from groundbreaking to move-in day.</p>
                    <p>Born and raised in NEPA, Ryan's investment in this region is personal. He builds homes here because this is where his family lives too.</p>
                    <blockquote class="ab-bio-quote ab-bio-quote--gold">"Building a home for someone is a big responsibility. We take that seriously — every decision, every detail, every day on the job."</blockquote>
